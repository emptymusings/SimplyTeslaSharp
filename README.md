# SimplyTeslaSharp
Simpl# libraries used in order to connect the Crestron Series 3 home automation system to a Tesla Vehicle

# Requirements:
Crestron Simpl Windows application
Crestron Series 3 processor

# Prerequisites:
A working knowledge of Crestron Simpl Windows.  No knowledge of Simpl+ or Simpl# is necessary, but it could help.

This library is tested using a Crestron MC-3 and a Tesla Model 3.  Tesla's API should work with any model of Tesla vehicle, though I have not had the opportunity to try yet.
